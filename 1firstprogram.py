What is Programming?
Just like we use Hindi or English to communicate with each other, we use a Programming language Python to communicate with the computer.

Programming is a way to instruct the computer to perform various tasks.

What is Python?
Python is simple and easy to understand language which feels like reading simple English. This Pseudo code nature of Python makes it easy to learn and understandable for beginners.

Features of Python:
Easy to understand = Less development time
Free and open source
High-level language
Portable – works on Windows/Linux/Mac
+ Fun to work with :)
Installation

Python can be easily installed from python.org

When you click on the download button, python can be installed right after you complete the setup by executing the file for your platform.

Tip: Just install it like a game ☻

 

Chapter 1: Modules, Comments & Pip
Let’s write our very first python program.

Create a file called hello.py and paste the below code in it

print(“Hello World”)         => print is a function (more later)

Execute this file (.py file) by typing python hello.py and you will see Hello World printed on the screen.

Modules
A module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) which can be imported and used in our programs.

Pip
Pip is a package manager for python. You can use pip to install a module on your system.

E.g. pip install flask (It will install flask module in your system)

Types of modules
There are two types of modules in Python:

Built-in modules – Pre-installed in Python
External modules – Need to install using pip
Some examples of built-in modules are os, abc, etc.

Some examples of external modules are TensorFlow, flask, etc.

Using Python as a Calculator

We can use python as a calculator by typing “python” + TO DO on the terminal. [It opens REPL or read evaluation print loop]

Comments
Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to execute.

Comments can be used to mark author name, date, etc.

Types of Comments:

There are two types of comments in python,

Single line comments – Written using # (pound/hash symbol)
Multi-line comments – Written using ‘’’ Comment ‘’’ or “”” Comment “””.
 

Chapter 1 – Practice Set
Write a program to print Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star poem in python.
Use REPL and print the table of 5 using it.
Install an external module and use it to perform an operation of your interest.
Write a python program to print the contents of a directory using os module. Search online for the function which does that.
Label the program written in problem 4 with comments.
